# Youtube Downloader (ytdlr)

Just Another Front End for Pytube3 (JAFE-FPT3)

This is a little tool that I have been meaning to write for a very long time. There are a multitude of sites out there that give you the ability to download audio and videos from YouTube.

I don't know what sits behind these web services. I also don't like the idea of downloading a random executable that may or may not
contain malicious code for the sake of grabbing a video or an audio track.

So with those thoughts in mind, I wanted to create something small for myself, with code that I can track. If anyone else finds this useful, then great!

Let me know what else I can include or improve on.

Anyway, enough gum flappin'
