### Youtube Downloader (ytdlr)

This is a little tool that I have been meaning to write for a very long time. There are a multitude of sites out there that give you this ability.
Some of the sites are innocent but a lot of them are very nefarious, I also don't like the idea of downloading a random executable that may or may not
contain malicious code.

So with those thoughts in might, I wanted to create something small for myself, with code that is easily viewable for the denizens of the internet.

Anyway, enough gum flappin'

## Dependencies

Ensure that you download the pytube3 package for this python script to work

There is a currently know bug, your best bet for getting pytube3 to run is by executing the following commands
```
pip3 uninstall -y pytube3
pip3 install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube
```
